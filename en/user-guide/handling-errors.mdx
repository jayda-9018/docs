---
This guide covers the main types of errors that can occur during API calls and their solutions. Supertone API indicates the cause of problems through **HTTP status codes**, and through this document, you can check in advance what errors may occur in which situations.

## 1. Error Code List
### **400 Bad Request**
This occurs when there's a problem with the request format itself. The most common causes are:
- Missing required fields like `text`, `language`
- Entering non-existent values for `style` or `model`
- `voice_settings` parameter values outside the allowed range (e.g., pitch_shift: 20)
- Invalid JSON or completely wrong format
- Text length exceeding 300 characters

> **Please check your request body again.** Using an editor or Linter to validate JSON structure is also recommended.

### **401 Unauthorized**
This occurs when the API Key is missing or incorrect.
- Missing `x-sup-api-key` header
- Using an incorrect key (different account key, expired key, etc.)

> **Please verify that you entered the API Key issued from the console correctly.** Be careful not to include leading or trailing spaces when copying strings.

### **402 Not Enough Credits**
This occurs when there aren't enough credits remaining to process the API call.
- Credits are 0 or insufficient for the expected call cost
- Plan not purchased in Play/console

> Purchase a plan or charge credits on the [Play subscription page](https://play.supertone.ai/subscription) and try again.\
> Credits are also deducted when calling cloned voices.

### **403 Forbidden**
This occurs when trying to access resources without permission.
- The `voice_id` doesn't belong to your account (e.g., another user's cloned voice)
- Sub-users of enterprise accounts trying to use resources they don't have permission for
- Using an API Key not issued from the console

> **Call GET /v1/voices** to recheck permission for that voice.\
> **Cloned voices can only be called by the account that created them.**\
> 403 occurs if the account is different.

### **404 Not Found**
This occurs when the specified resource cannot be found.
- Using a non-existent `voice_id`
- When filtering with too narrow conditions in `GET /voices/search` results in 0 results
- Typo in endpoint path

> Please recheck that the request path and parameter values are correct.\
> `voice_id` can be verified through the console or `GET /voices`.

### **408 Request Timeout**
This occurs when the server cannot process the request within a certain time.
- When the network is unstable or the request body is too large and complex
- When processing delays occur internally on the server

> If the same request repeatedly times out, please contact [customer support](https://support.supertone.ai/hc/en-us/categories/10267196754959-Play?_gl=1*tr7a0x*_gcl_au*NDgxOTUwMjcwLjE3NDc4MjQ4NDE.).\
> You can try simplifying the request or reducing input values.

### **429 Too Many Requests**
This occurs when too many requests come in within a certain time.
- The basic call limit is **20 times/minute** per account
- Exceeding this standard may temporarily delay or block responses

> Please wait a moment and send the request again.\
> For enterprise users, call limit increases are possible. ([Enterprise Inquiry](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YexQpjpK0ZEou12blTytkZLqvrV-Uv95GbhxoOQ54R8/edit))

### **500 Internal Server Error**
This is an unexpected internal server error.
- It's likely a temporary server issue
- Can occur intermittently even when there's no problem with the request itself

> If the same request repeatedly fails, please contact [customer support](https://support.supertone.ai/hc/en-us/categories/10267196754959-Play?_gl=1*tr7a0x*_gcl_au*NDgxOTUwMjcwLjE3NDc4MjQ4NDE.) including the request body.\
> Logging the occurrence time helps with problem resolution.

## 2. Frequently Occurring Cases Summary
- Getting 400 by calling without sending request body
- Getting 401 by incorrectly setting API Key in Postman environment variables
- Getting 403 when trying to call cloned voice from different account
- Getting 402 when calling again after using up all credits
- Getting 400 because input text was 310 characters (exceeding 300 character limit)

## 3. Error Response Tips
- Most errors can be immediately identified along with HTTP status codes
- Error messages don't include detailed descriptions, so carefully review your request content
- For recurring errors, contact [customer support](https://support.supertone.ai/hc/en-us/categories/10267196754959-Play?_gl=1*tr7a0x*_gcl_au*NDgxOTUwMjcwLjE3NDc4MjQ4NDE.) including request body and header content.
