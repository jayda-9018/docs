The most important element in voice synthesis is the **voice ID** that determines which voice will read the text. This document guides you on how to find the desired voice and how to check voice information needed for API calls.

## 1. What is a Voice ID?

`voice_id` is a value that identifies one unique character.

When synthesizing speech, you need to pass **language**, **style**, and **model** information along with this voice ID to generate accurate speech.

## 2. Three Ways to Find Voice IDs

### 2.1 Copy from Supertone Play

The fastest and most intuitive way is to copy the `voice_id` from the voice library in Supertone Play.

- Click the **Copy voice ID** button within each voice item
- The voice's ID will be copied to your clipboard
- Cloned voices can also be checked in a separate tab

[Go to Supertone Play](https://play.supertone.ai)

**Preset Voice Example:**

**Cloned Voice Example:**

### 2.2 Get Complete Voice List with `GET /v1/voices`

To check the **complete list of available voices without conditions** through the API, use the `GET /voices` endpoint.

```http
GET /v1/voices
```

The response includes the following information:

- `voice_id`: ID to be used in calls
- `name`: Character name (e.g., Agatha, Adam, etc.)
- `language`: List of supported languages
- `styles`: List of selectable styles
- `models`: Available voice models
- `samples`: Sample audio by language/style/model
- `thumbnail_image_url`: Voice image

Response example:

```json
{
    "voice_id": "91992bbd4758bdcf9c9b01",
    "name": "Adam",
    "description": "",
    "age": "young-adult",
    "gender": "male",
    "use_case": "meme",
    "language": [
       "ko",
       "en",
       "ja"
       ],
     "styles": [
       "neutral"
       ],
     "models": [
       "sona_speech_1"
       ],
     "samples": [
       {
        "language": "ja",
        "style": "neutral",
        "model": "sona_speech_1",
        "url": "https://d2hxfz33hpdvze.cloudfront.net/voice-library/resources/20250502_044710.wAA5PFQe7BHNQjrfMiNrRd.speech.wav"
        },
       {
        "language": "ko",
        "style": "neutral",
        "model": "sona_speech_1",
        "url": "https://d2hxfz33hpdvze.cloudfront.net/voice-library/resources/20250502_044844.tehBuHoUhZcWsCfUsr15As.speech.wav"
        },
        {
         "language": "en",
         "style": "neutral",
         "model": "sona_speech_1",
         "url": "https://d2hxfz33hpdvze.cloudfront.net/voice-library/resources/20250201_132654.rdMFfzDsaub9qXABwti65M.speech.wav"
         }
         ],
         "thumbnail_image_url": "https://d2hxfz33hpdvze.cloudfront.net/voice-library/resources/7wmvg5vEBeooDEB9xnut6s.png"
}
```

### 2.3 Filter by Conditions with `GET /v1/voices/search`

If you want to find only voices that match specific language, style, or purpose, try the `GET /voices/search` endpoint.

```http
GET /v1/voices/search?language=ko&style=happy
```

**Supported Filters:**

- `language`: Language code (ko, en, ja, etc.)
- `style`: Emotional style (neutral, happy, etc.)
- `name`, `description`, `gender`, `age`, `use_case` can also be searched

**Sorting functionality is not supported**, and accurate condition specification is important.

### **ðŸ“Œ Looking for Cloned Voices?**

Searching with `name=My Voice` will show all cloned voices created in your current account.

```http
GET /v1/voices/search?name=My Voice
```

A response example for the above search is as follows:

```json
{
    "items": [
        {
            "voice_id": "opSGuRvHBe7EfZ4LQga1hE",
            "name": "My Voice 1",
            "description": "",
            "age": "",
            "gender": "",
            "use_case": "",
            "language": [
                "ja"
            ],
            "styles": [
                "jealous"
            ],
            "models": [
                "sona_speech_1"
            ],
            "samples": [
                {
                    "language": "ja",
                    "style": "jealous",
                    "model": "sona_speech_1",
                    "url": "https://d2hxfz33hpdvze.cloudfront.net/voice-library/resources/20250514_160801.bDwEhmuq8JALRMP3nSHzUD.speech.wav"
                }
            ],
            "thumbnail_image_url": ""
        },
        {
            "voice_id": "hZGrJcUTNSNwfZDzasAVUh",
            "name": "My Voice 2",
            "description": "",
            "age": "",
            "gender": "",
            "use_case": "",
            "language": [
                "en"
            ],
            "styles": [
                "active"
            ],
            "models": [
                "sona_speech_1"
            ],
            "samples": [
                {
                    "language": "en",
                    "style": "active",
                    "model": "sona_speech_1",
                    "url": "https://d2hxfz33hpdvze.cloudfront.net/voice-library/resources/20250514_161008.ekky3mQgtgVLWLa54ispy5.speech.wav"
                }
            ],
            "thumbnail_image_url": ""
        }
    ],
    "total": 2,
    "next_page_token": null
}
```

## 3. Check Sample Audio and Style Information

The `samples` field in the voice object contains sample audio based on language, style, and model combinations.

```json
{
  "language": "ko",
  "style": "neutral",
  "model": "sona_speech_1",
  "url": "https://.../speech.wav"
}
```

Accessing this URL allows you to download actual speech samples. Since different characters support different style/language/model combinations, please check before use.

## 4. Next Steps

Once you've found a voice ID, refer to the [Text-to-Speech Guide](/en/user-guide/text-to-speech) to continue with text input, parameter settings, and audio output format specification.
