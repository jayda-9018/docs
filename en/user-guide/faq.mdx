---

We've organized the most frequently asked questions by topic, from those first using the API to users who have integrated cloned voices.

## 1. Get Started with API

<Accordion title="Where can I get an API Key?">
  You can get it immediately by signing up for the service in the [console](https://console.supertoneapi.com). You can use up to 3 Keys per account, and revocation and reissuance are possible in case of leakage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I integrate the API?">
  When making HTTP requests, put the issued Key in the `x-sup-api-key` header. For detailed integration methods, please refer to [Quick Start](/en/user-guide/quickstart).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to use a different account from Play?">
  No. Play and API operate on the same account basis.
</Accordion>

## 2. Voice & API Calls

<Accordion title="Where can I check available voice IDs?">
  Voice IDs can be checked through the following three methods:

  1. Copy from the voice library in Supertone Play
  2. Call GET /v1/voices endpoint for complete inquiry
  3. Call GET /v1/voices/search endpoint for conditional search
     For more details, please check the [Voice Selection Guide](/en/user-guide/voice-selection).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use cloned voices in the API?">
  Yes. Cloned voices created in Play can also be called in the API with the same account. Cloned voice creation is only possible in Play.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I find the ID of a cloned voice?">
  By searching with `GET /v1/voices/search?name=My Voice`, you can filter and check only cloned voices created within your account.
  For more details, please check the [Voice Selection Guide](/en/user-guide/voice-selection).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I make calls just knowing the voice ID?">
  No. In addition to `voice_id`, the `language`, `style`, and `model` combination must match exactly for voice to be generated normally.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What combinations are possible for each voice?">
  Through the `samples` field, you can check supported language/style/model combinations and sample audio for each voice.
  For more details, please check the [Voice Selection Guide](/en/user-guide/voice-selection).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is the style parameter required?">
  No. Style is optional, and the system's default style is automatically applied if not provided.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I adjust voice speed or pitch?">
  You can adjust `pitch_shift`, `pitch_variance`, and `speed` through `voice_settings`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is the Predict Duration API for?">
  It's a feature that predicts the speech length of input text. **Credits are not deducted**.
</Accordion>

## 3. Credit & Pricing

<Accordion title="What is the API pricing plan?">
  It uses the same credit system as Play. Please check available plans on the [Play subscription page](https://play.supertone.ai/subscription).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I check my credit balance?">
  You can check through the following two methods:

  - Call `GET /v1/credits` API
  - Check console or Play dashboard
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Are credits only deducted from the API?">
  No. Play and API share the same credits.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use voices created in Play in the API?">
  Yes. Cloned voices created within the same account can be called in the API without additional settings.
</Accordion>
