To convert text to speech through Supertone API, you need to pass information such as text, language, and style along with a specific voice ID to the API.
This document provides step-by-step guidance on the complete call structure of the Text-to-Speech function, parameter configuration methods, response format, and voice adjustment options.

## 1. Endpoint and Basic Structure

```http
POST /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
```

### Required Headers

```http
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
Content-Type: application/json
```

### Path Parameters

- `voice_id`: Unique ID of the voice to use

### Query Parameters

- `output_format` (optional): Audio format to generate. Choose between `wav` (default) and `mp3`

## 2. Request Body

Requests are sent in JSON format and can include the following fields:

| Field            | Required | Description                                                                             |
| :--------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`           | ✅        | Text to convert to speech (max 300 characters)                                          |
| `language`       | ✅        | Language of the text. Choose within languages supported by the voice (`ko`, `en`, `ja`) |
| `style`          | ❌        | Emotional style to apply (`neutral`, `happy`, etc.). Uses default style if not provided |
| `model`          | ❌        | Voice model to use (`sona_speech_1`). Automatically applied if omitted                  |
| `voice_settings` | ❌        | Advanced options to adjust voice pitch, intonation, and speed (see below)               |

## 3. Complete Request Example

```http
POST /v1/text-to-speech/91992bbd4758bdcf9c9b01?output_format=mp3
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "text": "안녕하세요, 수퍼톤 API입니다.",
  "language": "ko",
  "style": "neutral",
  "model": "sona_speech_1",
  "voice_settings": {
    "pitch_shift": 0,
    "pitch_variance": 1,
    "speed": 1
  }
}
```

## 4. `voice_settings` Options

`voice_settings` is an advanced option you can use when you want to fine-tune the speech feel of the generated voice.

| Parameter        | Description                                                                                                                                       | Allowed Range | Default |
| :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------ | :------ |
| `pitch_shift`    | Adjusts the pitch level.<br />0 is the original voice pitch, with ±12 steps possible. 1 step is a semitone.                                       | -12 ~ \+12    | 0       |
| `pitch_variance` | Controls the degree of intonation variation during speech.<br />Smaller values create flatter intonation, larger values create richer intonation. | 0.1 ~ 2       | 1       |
| `speed`          | Controls speech speed.<br />Values less than 1 make it slower, values greater than 1 make it faster.                                              | 0.5 ~ 2       | 1       |

> ⚠️ Values outside the range will apply default values.\
> Extreme adjustment values may degrade voice quality.

## 5. Response

On success, responds with an audio stream (`audio/wav` or `audio/mpeg`).\
Audio length can be checked through headers.

```http
X-Audio-Length: 3.42
```

The above example indicates that 3.42 seconds of speech was generated.

## 6. Text Input Considerations

- Text can be input up to **300 characters maximum**.
- Too short sentences may result in unnatural speech.
- **Only Korean, English, and Japanese are supported**; other languages may produce unexpected results.
- Emojis and special symbols may not be read or may be ignored.

## 7. Model Selection

Currently, only one model `sona_speech_1` is supported.\
This parameter is optional, and the default model is automatically applied if not provided.

## 8. Check Speech Duration First with Predict Duration API

Even without generating speech, you can predict how many seconds of speech the input text will produce.

```http
POST /v1/predict-duration/{voice_id}
```

- Request method is the same as TTS
- Response example:

```json
{
  "duration": 2.87
}
```
