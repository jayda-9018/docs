This page is designed for those who are new to Supertone API to\
**quickly experience the voice synthesis workflow**.
Follow the steps below to complete your first API call.

## 1. Get API Key and Prepare Authentication
Supertone API uses API Key-based authentication.\
Sign up for the console and create a new service to immediately receive your API Key.

- Console URL: https://console.supertoneapi.com
- You can issue up to 3 API Keys per account, and revocation and reissuance are possible when needed.
- When making API calls, include the issued key in the `x-sup-api-key` header.

```bash
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
```

## 2. Check Available Voice IDs
Voice ID is the key that determines which voice will read the text. You can check the voices available in your current account through the following three methods:

### 2.1 Copy from Supertone Play
The easiest way to check voice IDs is to copy them from the voice library in Supertone Play.

As shown in the example image below, clicking the 'Copy voice ID' button within each voice will copy that voice's `voice_id` to your clipboard.

Cloned voices can also be copied using the same method.

</Frame>

The copied ID can be used directly in the console or API.

### 2.2 Check All Voices at Once
Using the GET /voices endpoint, you can retrieve a complete list of available voices without any conditions.

```http
GET /v1/voices
```

### 2.3 Find Voices by Conditions
GET /v1/voices/search allows you to filter voices based on language, style, etc.

- Example: Query only Korean voices with 'happy' style
```http
GET /v1/voices/search?language=ko&style=happy
```

You can check each voice's id field to use in actual calls.

## 3. Generate Voice
Once you've confirmed the voice ID, you can now convert text to speech.
Here's a basic call example:

```http
POST /v1/text-to-speech/e5f6fb1a53d0add87afb4f
Content-Type: application/json
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]

{
  "text": "안녕하세요, 수퍼톤 API입니다.",
  "language": "ko",
  "style": "neutral",
  "model": "sona_speech_1"
}
```

The response is returned as an audio file stream format (WAV), and you can check the length of the generated voice through the X-Audio-Length value in the header.

You're now ready to integrate Supertone API. Move on to the next step to explore more diverse settings and advanced usage.
