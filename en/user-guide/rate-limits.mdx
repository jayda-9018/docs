Supertone API operates basic call limit policies to prevent excessive requests for stable service operation.

## 1. Rate Limit

Currently, the following call limits apply to all accounts:

  Based on the sum of all endpoints
</Card>

This limit applies commonly to all API requests including voice queries, text-to-speech conversion, usage queries, etc.

## 2.  When Limit Is Exceeded

To prevent system overload, **temporary blocking or speed reduction may occur** when requests exceed a certain level.

‚Äª Actual blocking varies depending on the situation, and in some requests, responses may be delayed or missed without additional notice.

## 3. Need Higher Rate Limit?

If you need to make API calls more frequently, you can apply more flexible call policies through **Enterprise Plan** or separate contracts. You can negotiate call limit conditions according to your operating environment or service characteristics.
