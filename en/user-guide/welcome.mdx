## Getting Started
This documentation is a guide prepared for those who are new to the Supertone API. It's structured to help you quickly learn the overall flow of generating voices, searching for voices, and managing usage through the API.

The Supertone API is an integrated service with Supertone Play, allowing you to register voices, recharge credits, and perform voice synthesis all with a single account. It's designed to be easily accessible not only for developers familiar with APIs, but also for users who operate services primarily through Play.
