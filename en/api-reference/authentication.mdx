title: "Authentication"
description: "Supertone API uses API Key-based authentication. All requests must be authenticated by including the issued API Key in the header."
---
## 1. API Key Issuance
You can get an API Key immediately after signing up for the service in Supertone API console.
- You can issue up to 3 API Keys per account.
- In case of leakage, immediate deletion and reissuance are possible from the console.

## 2. Authentication Method
Supertone API uses a custom HTTP header called `x-sup-api-key` for authentication.
```http
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
```
This header must be included in all requests, and authentication errors will occur if omitted.

## 3. Example
```bash
curl -X GET "https://supertoneapi.com/v1/voices" \
  -H "x-sup-api-key: yourapikeyhere"
```

## 4. Authentication Failure
- `401 Unauthorized`: When API Key is missing or invalid
- `403 Forbidden`: When there's no access permission for the resource (e.g., no cloned voice permission)

> When errors occur, please also refer to the [Error Handling](/en/user-guide/handling-errors) guide.

## 5. Security Considerations
- Do not expose API Keys in client-side code; always manage them securely on the server side.
- If a key is exposed externally, immediately revoke it from the console and issue a new one.
