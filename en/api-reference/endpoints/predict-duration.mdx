title: "Predict Duration"
description: "An API that returns only the expected length without generating speech, useful for billing prediction or text length adjustment."
openapi: "/openapi.json POST /v1/predict-duration/{voice_id}"
---
This API **does not actually generate speech**,\
but only returns the expected speech length (in seconds) based on the input text.
It's **useful for understanding expected credit consumption or adjusting text length** before making TTS calls.

### Usage
- The calling method and Request Body are almost identical to the `text-to-speech` API.
- However, only the `duration` value is returned as a result, not audio.
- **No credits are consumed** when calling the Predict Duration API.

### Request Body Items Description
| Item               | Required | Description                                     |
| :--------------- | :-- | :------------------------------------- |
| `text`           | ✅  | Text to analyze. Maximum 300 characters                     |
| `language`       | ✅  | Text language. One of `ko`, `en`, `ja`          |
| `style`          | ❌  | Emotional style. Default style is used if not specified    |
| `model`          | ❌  | Default is `sona_speech_1`. Currently only this model is available |
| `voice_settings` | ❌  | Speech speed or pitch adjustment values. May affect result length       |

### Usage Example
```http
POST /v1/predict-duration/{voice_id}
Content-Type: application/json
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]

{
  "text": "This is a long-form sentence for duration prediction.",
  "language": "en",
  "style": "neutral"
}
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "duration": 3.57381983
}
```
This means that generating this text would create approximately 3.57 seconds of audio.

### Usage Tips
- **Credits are not actually deducted.** (because no speech generation occurs)
- You can get results very similar to when actually calling with the same text.
- Since adjusting `voice_settings.speed` changes the length, it's better to test with a fixed speech speed.
