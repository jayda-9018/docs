title: "Get Credit Balance"
description: "A simple API that queries the available credit balance of the current account."
openapi: "/openapi.json GET /v1/credits"
---
This API queries the **available credit balance** of the current account.\
Since Supertone Play and API use the same credit system, credits charged in Play apply directly to the API as well.

### Request Method
```http
GET /v1/credits
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "balance": 146
}
```
This means 146 credits are currently available.

### Reference Information
- Credits are charged on a **per-minute basis**.
- Credits are **shared between Play and API**.
- Basic trial credits may be provided upon new registration.
