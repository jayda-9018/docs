### Example 1: Finding Cloned Voices

```http
GET /v1/voices/search?name=My Voice
```

→ You can search for cloned voices registered in your account (e.g., `My Voice`) to get the `voice_id`.

### Example 2: Style and Language Condition Filter

```http
GET /v1/voices/search?style=happy&language=ko,en
```

Only voices that include happy in style and contain at least one of Korean (ko) and English (en) in language will be retrieved.

### Example 3: Apply Pagination

```http
GET /v1/voices/search?page_size=50&next_page_token=eyJpZCI6IjEyMzQ1In0=
```

- Fetches the next page in units of 50.
- The `next_page_token` value can be obtained from the previous response.

### Important Notes

- All parameters **can accept multiple conditions (OR) separated by commas.**

  ```http
  language=ko,en&style=happy,sad
  ```
- If non-existent combinations are entered, the response will be 200 OK but the results may be empty.
- The response structure includes an `items` array and `next_page_token` value, and also provides each voice's `voice_id`, style, sample URL, etc.
