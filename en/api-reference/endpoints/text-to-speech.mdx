This is the **TTS (Text-to-Speech) API** that converts text to speech using a specified voice.\
Through this API, you can generate natural speech from desired sentences.

### Basic Usage

- `{voice_id}`: Only **character-based IDs** can be used
- Parameters like `language`, `style`, `model` are **included in the Request Body**

### Request Body Items Description

| :--------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`           | ✅        | Text to convert. Up to 300 characters can be input                                                                |
| `language`       | ✅        | Language of the text. One of `ko`, `en`, `ja`                                                                     |
| `style`          | ❌        | Emotional style. E.g., `neutral`, `happy`, `sad`, etc. If not specified, the character's default style is applied |
| `model`          | ❌        | Model to use. Default is `sona_speech_1`. Currently only this model is available                                  |
| `voice_settings` | ❌        | Pitch/speed adjustment. Includes `pitch_shift`, `pitch_variance`, `speed` fields (defaults: 0, 1, 1)              |

### Request Example

```http
POST /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
Content-Type: application/json
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]

{
  "text": "Thank you for calling.",
  "language": "en",
  "style": "happy",
  "model": "sona_speech_1",
  "voice_settings": {
    "pitch_shift": 0,
    "pitch_variance": 1,
    "speed": 1
  }
}
```

### Response

- Response body is returned as **binary audio file**, default format is `wav`
- Can also respond in mp3 format by passing `output_format=mp3` as query parameter
- Voice length (seconds) can be checked through `X-Audio-Length` header

### Important Notes

- **`400 error occurs when text length exceeds 300 characters`**.
- Calls are possible even without `style`, but default styles may vary by character, so please call Get Voices API to check the default style (the first value in the styles array is the default).
- The audio file in the response can be directly saved or played (appropriate handling required depending on client).
