<Warning>
  ### The official version has been deployed as of now (after May 28, 2025).

  The current official API version (`/v1/...`) **was deployed as of May 28, 2025**, and for new integrations, please no longer use sandbox endpoints and integrate the `/v1` **version instead.**

  **If you are already integrated and using the sandbox:**\
  You just need to modify the URL from `/sandbox/...` ‚Üí `/v1/...` before June 6, 2025.

  **If you have never integrated or used the sandbox:**\
  You can skip this document and refer only to the official version documentation.

  üìÑ Go to official documentation: [API Reference](/en/api-reference/introduction)
</Warning>

In the sandbox environment, the existing voice ID system has been **completely revamped**.\
The old complex voice IDs in the form of `{character-language-style}` will disappear,\
and now you can call more concisely with a combination of ****`character-based voice_id + parameters (`**** `language, style)`.

### üóÇ Voice ID Mapping Table

> üîó [View Voice ID Mapping Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPP9rxE8lWKrkhU91pdHUxOfYGEpqRSDaIybmVBFFZ0/edit?usp=sharing)

In the sheet, you can check **Old Voice ID** and **New Voice ID \+ language/style parameters** in a 1:1 relationship.\
For example, they are replaced as follows:

| Old Voice ID             | New Voice ID             | Name   | language | style     |
| :----------------------- | :----------------------- | ------ | :------- | :-------- |
| `wq4QNZra8YVCTWGVXbC`    | `91992bbd4758bdcf9c9b0`  | Adam   | `ko`     | `neutral` |
| `vG4KaR4wwG5mvdCJfyrbWN` | `7d6fa2e0c4abfd9e1acc4c` | Yoonho | `en`     | `happy`   |

The mapping table includes various style combinations by character,\
and many **characters that didn't exist before** and **new styles** have been added.

### ‚úÖ Replacement Method

1. **Search for the Old Voice ID you've been using in the mapping table**.
2. **Extract the corresponding New Voice ID along with language/style parameters**.
3. When calling the API, enter the new ID in `voice_id`, and pass `language` and `style` as parameters.

```json
POST /sandbox/text-to-speech/{91992bbd4758bdcf9c9b0}
{
  "text": "This is an example sentence.",
  "language": "ko",
  "style": "neutral"
}
```

### üß≠ Notes

- In most cases, style defaults to neutral and is optional.\
  If not specified, the voice will be generated with the default style set in the system.
- In the new system, you can selectively call various styles/languages with the same character ID.

### ‚ùì Can't Find Your Voice ID?

If you cannot find the Old Voice ID you've been using in the mapping table,\
it may be that the voice is not supported in the new model or has been integrated.\
Please contact Customer Support for a quick confirmation.
