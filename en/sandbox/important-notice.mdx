title: "What is Sandbox?"
description: "A temporary test environment introduced due to changes in Supertone API structure, allowing you to preview the new calling methods."
---

Supertone API will officially grand open on May 28, 2025, along with the end of the closed beta.\
Accordingly, some call structures, parameters, and voice ID systems of the existing API (`v1` endpoint) will be changed.

To help you **reflect and test these changes without service interruption**,\
Supertone provides a **temporary sandbox environment from May 19 to June 6, 2025**.

### üîß What is Sandbox?

Sandbox is a **temporary test environment where you can practice the new calling methods** of Supertone API (TTS models, voice ID, style parameters, etc.).\
Even users who have already applied the existing `v1` API to their live environment can try migrating to the new structure in advance through the sandbox.

### üïí Operation Period

> **May 19, 2025 (Mon) ‚Äì June 6, 2025 (Fri)**\
> This is a temporary environment provided for about 3 weeks.

### üß≠ Why You Need Sandbox

- There have been **important structural changes** to the existing API calling method due to the grand opening.
- In particular, the voice ID in the format of `{character-language-style}` has been **simplified to character ID unit**, and instead, **style and language have been separated as parameters**.
- Therefore, sandbox is necessary for users who find it **difficult to modify their existing API call code immediately** or\
  need to **test the transition without service interruption**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Summary of Changes

| Item | Existing v1 API | After Change (Sandbox and Official) |
| :----- | :----------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| Voice ID | `{serin-ko-happy}` | `{serin}` \+ `language`, `style` parameters |
| Style Specification | Included in Voice ID | Separated as `style` parameter |
| Model Name | `"pro"`, `"turbo"` | `"sona_speech_1"` |
| Text Length | Maximum 200 characters | Maximum 300 characters |
| Billing Method | Post-paid ($0.1 per minute) | Credit-based pricing (integrated with Play) |

### üìù Notes

- **Actual credits will be deducted** in the sandbox environment,\
  so you must **charge credits through a plan registered in Play** before testing.
- The existing post-paid system is no longer supported, and\
  if you are using an API Key that was not issued through the console (applies only to enterprise customers), you must **reissue the API Key through the API console** to call the sandbox.
