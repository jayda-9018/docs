<Warning>
  ### The official version has been deployed as of now (after May 28, 2025).

  The current official API version (`/v1/...`) **was deployed as of May 28, 2025**, and for new integrations, please no longer use sandbox endpoints and integrate the `/v1` **version instead.**

  **If you are already integrated and using the sandbox:**\
  You just need to modify the URL from `/sandbox/...` ‚Üí `/v1/...` before June 6, 2025.

  **If you have never integrated or used the sandbox:**\
  You can skip this document and refer only to the official version documentation.

  üìÑ Go to official documentation: [API Reference](/en/api-reference/introduction)
</Warning>

Supertone API will have its official grand opening on May 28, 2025, with the end of the closed beta.\
Accordingly, some calling structures, parameters, and voice ID systems of the existing API (`v1` endpoints) will be changed.

To allow users to **reflect and test these changes without interruption**,\
Supertone provides a **temporary sandbox environment from May 19 to June 6, 2025**.

### üîß What is Sandbox?

Sandbox is a **temporary test environment where you can practice** the new calling methods of Supertone API (TTS models, voice ID, style parameters, etc.) **in advance**.\
Users who have already applied the existing `v1` API to their live environment can also try migration to the new structure in advance through the sandbox.

### üïí Operation Period

> **May 19, 2025 (Mon) ‚Äì June 6, 2025 (Fri)**\
> A temporary environment provided for approximately 3 weeks.

### üß≠ Why Sandbox is Needed

- **Important structural changes** have occurred in the existing API calling methods due to the grand opening.
- In particular, voice IDs in `{character-language-style}` format have been **simplified to character ID units**, and instead **style and language have been separated as parameters**.
- Therefore, sandbox is needed for users who find it **difficult to modify existing API calling code immediately** or who need to **test transitions without service interruption**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Changed Structure Summary

| Item                | Existing v1 API                 | After Change (Sandbox and Official)         |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------ |
| Voice ID            | `{serin-ko-happy}`              | `{serin}` \+ `language`, `style` parameters |
| Style Specification | Included in voice ID            | Separated as `style` parameter              |
| Model Name          | `"pro"`, `"turbo"`              | `"sona_speech_1"`                           |
| Text Length         | Maximum 200 characters          | Maximum 300 characters                      |
| Billing Method      | Post-payment (\$0.1 per minute) | Credit-based pricing (integrated with Play) |

### üìù Notes

- **Actual credits are deducted** in the sandbox environment,\
  so you must **charge credits through a plan registered in Play** before testing.
- The existing post-payment system is no longer supported,\
  and if you are using API Keys not issued through the console (applies only to enterprise customers), you must **reissue API Keys through the API console** to make sandbox calls.
