<Accordion title="My existing voice_id no longer works.">
  In the sandbox, you cannot use the existing `{character-language-style}` format of voice_id.\
  Now only **character-based voice_id** is available, and style and language have been separated as parameters.

  - `voice_id` ‚Üí Character-based Voice ID (Ïòà: `91992bbd4758bdcf9c9b0`)
  - `language`, `style` ‚Üí Passed as parameters

  üìÑ [View Voice ID Mapping Table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RPP9rxE8lWKrkhU91pdHUxOfYGEpqRSDaIybmVBFFZ0/edit?usp=sharing)

  üëâ IDs not in the mapping table may not have been integrated into the new version.\
  In that case, please contact customer support.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do I need to enter the style parameter?">
  **No, it's optional.**\
  The style parameter is optional, and if not entered, the default style set for that character will be automatically applied.\
  However, since each character has different styles, some characters may have **a style other than "neutral" as default**, so it's recommended to specify the style directly if you need a specific style.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I use clone voices in the API as well?">
  **Yes, it's now possible.**\
  Clone voices (e.g., 'My Voice 1') created in Play can also be called from the sandbox and official API.

  **How to find the voice ID:**

  - Call the `/sandbox/voices/search` endpoint and
  - Pass a search term like `name=My Voice` to the `query` parameter
  - You can then check the ID of the clone voice registered to your account.

  ```http
  GET /sandbox/voices/search?name=My Voice
  ```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I continue using my existing API Key?">
  **‚úÖ Most users can continue using it.**

  - If you're already using an **API Key issued through the console**, you can continue using it without any additional steps.

  **‚ö†Ô∏è However, enterprise customers meeting the following conditions must take action:**

  | Condition                                                | Action                             |
  | :------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------- |
  | Using a **legacy API Key** received as a text file, etc., without console registration | Must register on the console and reissue API Key |
  | Registered on the console, but **missing custom voice settings, etc.**            | Separate consultation with Supertone required (voice permission transfer, etc.)    |

<Accordion title="Will credits be deducted when calling the TTS API in the sandbox?">
  **Yes, actual credits will be deducted when calling the TTS API in the sandbox.**\
  From this grand opening, the **post-payment system will be terminated**,\
  and a **prepaid credit-based pricing system identical to Play** will be applied.\
  However, no credits are deducted when calling the Predict Duration API.

  - Credit unit prices are the same as Play's pricing plans.
  - If you've already paid for a plan in Play, the same credits are shared in the sandbox.
  - Some free trial credits are also provided.

  üìå Credit balance check API: `GET /sandbox/credits`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I still use post-payment like before?">
  No. **Post-payment was a closed beta-exclusive policy**.\
  After the grand opening, it will be converted to credit-based, and **automatic payment and unpaid usage settlement functions will not be provided.**
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How can I find the ID of a clone voice or custom voice?">
  - You can check the list of all voices in your account at `/sandbox/voices` or `/sandbox/voices/search`.
  - Clone voices can be found by searching for `"My Voice"`.
  - For enterprise accounts with custom voices, Supertone will provide the voice_id separately.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What happens if I enter an incorrect style or language parameter?">
  - If you enter a non-existent style/language, a **400 Bad Request** error will occur.
  - Please make sure to enter parameters based on the values provided in the responses from `/sandbox/voices` or `/sandbox/voices/search`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How long can I use the sandbox?">
  The sandbox will only be operational from **May 19 to June 6, 2025**.\
  After that, the `/sandbox` endpoint will be terminated, and from May 28, the same specifications will be officially reflected on the `/v1` path, so please use the endpoints on the v1 path.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What needs to be changed when switching back from sandbox to v1?">
  - Only the API call path needs to be changed.

    ```vbnet
    /sandbox/text-to-speech ‚Üí /v1/text-to-speech
    ```
  - Voice ID, parameter structure, model name, etc., will all remain the same.
</Accordion>
