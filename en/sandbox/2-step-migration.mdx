<Warning>
  ### The official version has been deployed as of now (after May 28, 2025).

  The current official API version (`/v1/...`) **was deployed as of May 28, 2025**, and for new integrations, please no longer use sandbox endpoints and integrate the `/v1` **version instead.**

  **If you are already integrated and using the sandbox:**\
  You just need to modify the URL from `/sandbox/...` → `/v1/...` before June 6, 2025.

  **If you have never integrated or used the sandbox:**\
  You can skip this document and refer only to the official version documentation.

  📄 Go to official documentation: [API Reference](/en/api-reference/introduction)
</Warning>

For transitioning from the existing API (v1) to the new call structure,\
Supertone recommends the following **2-step migration flow**.\
Each step **proceeds sequentially according to the schedule**, allowing you to test and apply changes without interruption through the sandbox.

### ✅ Step 1: Preparation and Sandbox Transition (May 19 - May 27)

**Goal:**\
Replace existing `v1` API usage code with `sandbox` **API for testing**.

**To-do during this period:**

- Replace existing voice_id with **new ID \+ parameters (language, style)** combination
- Modify API call URL from `/v1/...` to `/sandbox/...`
- If using legacy API Key → **Issue new API Key** from console
- Individual users: **Subscribe to a plan and charge credits** in Play
- Enterprise customers: **Register for enterprise and consult on account/voice settings**
- Conduct tests for all features (TTS, voice search, usage check, etc.)

> ⏱ _TIP: This period is the final check before actual service implementation._

### ✅ Step 2: Official Transition (May 28 - June 6)

**Goal:**\
With the official grand opening, restore API calls back to `v1`.\
You only need to change the `/sandbox/` path back to `/v1/`.

**Changes afterward:**

- `v1` API specifications will be changed to match the sandbox
- Credit system and voice_id structure remain the same as applied in the sandbox
- `/sandbox` **will no longer be provided** (ending June 6)

### 🔁 Flow Summary

<Card title="Migration Actions by Period" icon="sparkles">
  - Using existing v1
  - 5/19~5/27: Transition to sandbox environment and testing
  - 5/28~6/6: sandbox → v1 re-transition → Official application
</Card>

### 📌 Notes

- **Legacy voice IDs, model names, and calls without style may cause errors from May 28**
- If the call structure is not sufficiently tested in the sandbox,\
  there is a risk of service interruption, so please complete preliminary testing.
