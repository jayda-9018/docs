description: "A simple API for checking the available credit balance in the current account."
openapi: "/openapi.json GET /sandbox/credits"
---

This API checks the **available credit balance** of the current account.\
Supertone Play and API use the same credit system, so credits charged in Play are applied to the API as well.

### Request Method
```http
GET /sandbox/credits
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "balance": 146
}
```
â†’ This means that 146 credits are currently available for use.

### Notes
- Credits are charged on a **per-minute** basis.
- Credits are **shared between Play and API**.
- New sign-ups may receive default trial credits.
