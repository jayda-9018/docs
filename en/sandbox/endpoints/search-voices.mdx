### Example 1: Finding Clone Voices
```http
GET /sandbox/voices/search?name=My Voice
```
→ Search for clone voices (e.g., `My Voice`) registered in your account to get the `voice_id`.

### Example 2: Style and Language Condition Filters
```http
GET /sandbox/voices/search?style=happy&language=ko,en
```
→ Only retrieves voices that include happy in their style and include at least one of Korean (ko) or English (en) in their languages.

### Example 3: Applying Pagination
```http
GET /sandbox/voices/search?page_size=50&next_page_token=eyJpZCI6IjEyMzQ1In0=
```
→ Fetches the next page in units of 50 items.\
→ The `next_page_token` value can be obtained from the previous response.

### Notes
- All parameters **can accept multiple conditions (OR) separated by commas.**
  ```http
  language=ko,en&style=happy,sad
  ```
- If you enter a combination that doesn't exist, the response will still be 200 OK, but the results may be empty.
- The response structure includes an `items` array and a `next_page_token` value, along with each voice's `voice_id`, styles, sample URLs, and more.
