title: "Predict Duration"
description: "An API that returns only the estimated duration without generating voice, useful for billing prediction or text length adjustment."
openapi: "/openapi.json POST /sandbox/predict-duration/{voice_id}"
---

This API **returns only the estimated voice duration (in seconds)** based on the input text\
**without actually generating the audio**.
It's useful for **understanding expected credit consumption or adjusting text length** before making TTS calls.

### Usage Method
- The calling method and Request Body are almost identical to the `text-to-speech` API.
- However, it returns only the `duration` value rather than audio.
- **No credits are consumed** when calling the Predict Duration API.

### Request Body Parameters
| Parameter        | Required | Description                                    |
| :--------------- | :-- | :------------------------------------- |
| `text`           | ✅  | Text to analyze. Maximum 300 characters |
| `language`       | ✅  | Text language. One of `ko`, `en`, `ja` |
| `style`          | ❌  | Emotional style. If not specified, default style is used |
| `model`          | ❌  | Default is `sona_speech_1`. Currently only this model is available |
| `voice_settings` | ❌  | Speech rate or pitch adjustment values. May affect the resulting duration |

### Usage Example
```http
POST /sandbox/predict-duration/{voice_id}
Content-Type: application/json
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
{
  "text": "This is a long-form sentence for duration prediction.",
  "language": "en",
  "style": "neutral"
}
```

### Response Example
```json
{
  "duration": 3.57381983
}
```
→ This means that generating this text would create audio approximately 3.57 seconds in length.

### Usage Tips
- **Credits are not actually deducted** (since no voice is being generated).
- You can get results that are very similar to when you actually call the same text.
- Adjusting `voice_settings.speed` will change the length, so it's better to test with a fixed speech rate.
