---

This is a **TTS (Text-to-Speech) API** that converts text into speech using a specified voice.\
Through this API, you can generate natural voice for your desired sentences.

### Basic Usage
- `{voice_id}`: Only **character-level IDs** can be used
- Parameters such as `language`, `style`, and `model` are included in the **Request Body**

### Request Body Parameters
| Parameter         | Required | Description                                                           |
| :--------------- | :-- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `text`           | ✅  | Text to convert. Maximum 300 characters                                  |
| `language`       | ✅  | Language of the text. One of `ko`, `en`, `ja`                           |
| `style`          | ❌  | Emotional style. Ex: `neutral`, `happy`, `sad`, etc. If not specified, the character's default style is applied |
| `model`          | ❌  | Model to use. Default is `sona_speech_1`. Currently only this model is available |
| `voice_settings` | ❌  | Pitch/speed adjustment. Includes `pitch_shift`, `pitch_variance`, `speed` fields (defaults: 0, 1, 1) |

### Usage Example
```http
POST /sandbox/text-to-speech/{voice_id}
Content-Type: application/json
x-sup-api-key: [YOUR_API_KEY]
{
  "text": "Thank you for calling.",
  "language": "en",
  "style": "happy",
  "model": "sona_speech_1",
  "voice_settings": {
    "pitch_shift": 0,
    "pitch_variance": 1,
    "speed": 1
  }
}
```

### Response
- The response body is returned as a **binary audio stream**, with `wav` as the default format
- MP3 format is also available by passing `output_format=mp3` as a query parameter
- The length of the audio (in seconds) can be checked through the `X-Audio-Length` header

### Important Notes
- `voice_id` must be a **character-level ID**, not the previous `{character-language-style}` format.
- A 400 error will occur if the `text` length **exceeds 300 characters**.
- Calls are possible without a `style`, but the default style may vary by character, so please call the Get Voices API to check the default style (the first value in the style array is the default).
- The audio file in the response can be saved or played directly (appropriate handling required depending on the client).
